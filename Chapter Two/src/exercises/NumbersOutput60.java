 * t's common to print a rotating, increasing list of single-digit numbers at
 * the start of a program's output as a visual guide to number the columns of
 * the output to follow. With this in mind, write nested for loops to produce
 * the following output, with each line 60 characters wide:
 * 
 *          |         |         |         |         |         |
