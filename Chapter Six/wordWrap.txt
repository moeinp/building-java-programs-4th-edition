Write a method called wordWrap that accepts a Scanner repres
enting an input file as its parameter and outputs each line of the file to the console, 
word-wrapping all lines that are longer 
than 60 characters. For example, if a line contains 112 characters, the method should replace it with two lines: one containing the first 60 characters 
and another containing the final 52 characters. A line 
containing 217 characters should be wrapped into four lines: three 
of length 60 and a final line of length 37.
